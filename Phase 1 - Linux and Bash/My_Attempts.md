# My Attempts at Phase 1: Linux Command Line CTF Challenge

This document details my journey through the Phase 1 Linux Command Line CTF Challenge. Each challenge has been a learning experience, and I hope my notes and solutions can help others on their path.

For these tasks, I will be using the Windows Subsystem for Linux via Visual Studio Code, remoting into the virtual machine created via the Terraform template provided, I will be hosting this on Azure vs AWS as this is the cloud provider I primarily use currently.

## Challenge 1: The Hidden File

**Description**: Find and read a hidden file in the `ctf_challenges` directory.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: I used the `ls -a` command to list all files, including hidden ones, in the `ctf_challenges` directory.

**Solution**:
```sh
cd ctf_challenges
ls -a
cat .hidden_flag
```

**Notes**: Hidden files in Linux start with a dot (.) which is why they are not visible with a regular `ls` command.

## Challenge 2: The Secret File

**Description**: Locate a file containing "secret" in its name within /home/ctf_user.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: I utilized the `find` command to search for files with "secret" in their names.

**Solution**:
```sh
find /home/ctf_user -name "*secret*"
cat ./documents/projects/backup/secret_notes.txt
```

**Notes**: The `find` command is powerful for searching files based on various criteria.

## Challenge 3: The Largest Log

**Description**: Identify and read the largest file in /var/log.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: I used the `ls -S` command to sort files by size and then identified the largest file.

**Solution**:
```sh
cd /var/log
ls -S
tail -n 5 large_log_file.log # Displays the last 5 lines of the file
```

**Notes**: Sorting files by size helps quickly identify the largest files, using tail displays the end of the file.

## Challenge 4: The User Detective

**Description**: Find a flag in the .profile of the user with UID 1002.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: I checked the `/etc/passwd` file to find the user with UID 1002 and then read their .profile file.

**Solution**:
```sh
grep 1002 /etc/passwd
sudo cat /home/flag_user/.profile # ctf_user is a sudo user!
```

**Notes**: The `/etc/passwd` file contains user information, including UIDs, this allowed me to determine the user tied to the UID and navigate to their home directory.

## Challenge 5: The Permissive File

**Description**: Find a root-owned file with 777 permissions. The flag is the contents of this file.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: I used the `find` command to search for files with 777 permissions owned by root.

**Solution**:
```sh
find / -perm 777 -user root -type f -print 2>/dev/null
cat /opt/systems/config/system.conf
```

**Notes**: Understanding file permissions is crucial for this challenge as is redirecting console output, initially I ran the find command without the "2>/dev/null", this worked but showed many permission denied errors. I only wanted to see the results and exclude errors, by setting the type to "f" for file and redirecting errors to "/dev/null" I was presented with a single result.

## Challenge 6: The Hidden Service

**Description**: Identify a process on port 8080 and retrieve its flag.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: I used `netstat`, `lsof` and `curl` commands to identify the process running on port 8080.

**Solution**:
```sh
netstat -tuln | grep 8080
sudo lsof -i :8080
curl 127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Notes**: When using netstat I found a process listening on port 8080, by using lsof -i, I can list the process/command and PID to being "NC" when using "man nc" I noted that "nc" is short for "Netcat", essentially sending output over the network, since we know the listening port is 8080 and the type is http, I simply made a web-request to this port on the loopback address!

## Challenge 7: The Encoded Secret

**Description**: Decode a base64-encoded flag.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: I used the `base64` command to decode the flag.

**Solution**:
```sh
cat /home/ctf_user/ctf_challenges/encoded_flag.txt | base64 --d | base64 -d
```

**Notes**: Base64 encoding is commonly used for data encoding, in this example I decoded the initial contents of the file only to find that the contents were not as expected and seemed to still be BASE64? at first I was puzzled, thinking I had entered the command incorrectly so I created a file and encoded some text and decoded, this worked, noticing a pattern on the output I piped the results into decode again and discovered that the original contents were encoded twice!

## Challenge 8: SSH Key Authentication

**Description**: Configure SSH key authentication and find a hidden flag.

**Date of Attempt**: 11/02/2025

**Approach**: Use ssh-keygen to create an RSA key, copy this to the server, login with the thumbprint, explore the profile.

**Solution**:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id user@hostname
ssh user@hostname
cat /home/ctf_user/.ssh/secrets/backup/.authorized_keys
```

**Notes**: It may not have been necessary to create the RSA key and login via this method, however, I wanted to show I knew how to create and upload the key, after logging in, I checked the users ".ssh" folder and found that there was a "Secrets" and "Backup" folder which seemed unusual since "authorized_keys" and "known_hosts" usually reside here, browsing through these folders and displaying the contents of ".authorized_keys" showed the final flag.

---

**Key Takeaway**:

These challenges provided an engaging and interactive way to enhance my Linux command line skills. The difficulty level is suitable for entry-level Linux users and covers a range of tools and features that a cloud engineer may encounter. A few twists and turns such as nested Base64 encoding kept things interesting and challenge a users ability to think outside the box. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and tackling more advanced challenges in the future.
